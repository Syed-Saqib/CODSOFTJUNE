# Titanic Survival Prediction

This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about various passengers such as their age, gender, class, and fare, along with whether they survived or not. By analyzing this data and building a predictive model, we can estimate the likelihood of survival for future passengers.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the famous Titanic dataset, which can be found on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data). It consists of two CSV files:

- `train.csv`: Contains the training set with known survival outcomes.
- `test.csv`: Contains the test set without survival outcomes, which will be used to evaluate the performance of our predictive model.

Sure! Here's the modified version of the readme in the context of Sales Prediction Using Python:

# Sales Prediction Using Python

This project aims to predict the sales of products using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains information about various products such as their attributes, pricing, and historical sales data. By analyzing this data and building a predictive model, we can estimate the future sales of products and make informed business decisions.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project contains information about products and their historical sales. It can be obtained from an internal database or a data provider. The dataset should include attributes such as product features, pricing, sales date, and sales quantity.

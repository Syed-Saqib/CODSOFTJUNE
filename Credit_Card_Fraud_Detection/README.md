# Credit Card Fraud Detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. By utilizing classification algorithms, we aim to distinguish between genuine and fraudulent transactions, enabling financial institutions and businesses to effectively combat fraud.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains credit card transaction data, including various features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and customer information. The dataset should be appropriately anonymized and comply with privacy regulations.

## Requirements

Before running the project, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-learn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository: 
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/credit-card-fraud-detection.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.
```
cd credit-card-fraud-detection
```

3. Install the required dependencies.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Prepare the dataset: Ensure the dataset is available and properly formatted. If needed, preprocess and normalize the data. Handle any class imbalance issues that may be present.

5. Split the dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance accurately.

6. Train the model: Utilize a classification algorithm such as logistic regression or random forests to build the fraud detection model.

7. Evaluate the model: Use metrics such as precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance. Consider techniques like oversampling or undersampling to address any class imbalance and further improve results.

8. Make predictions: Deploy the trained model to make predictions on new credit card transactions and identify potential fraudulent activities.

9. Update the main script and documentation accordingly, incorporating any changes made during the development process.
